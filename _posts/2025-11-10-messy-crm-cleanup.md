# Messy CRM Cleanup: How to Turn Chaos into Reliable Data

A poorly maintained CRM can be costly for your business. Between duplicates, incomplete information, and misconfigured integrations, data quality deteriorates rapidly. In this article, we explain how to identify major issues and implement effective solutions.

## Most Common Problems

- **Duplicates and inconsistent data**: multiple entries for the same client or contact.
- **Missing information**: addresses, emails, interaction history.
- **Failing multi-system integrations**: CRM, billing, analytics that don't communicate properly.
- **Ineffective automations**: poorly configured or outdated workflows.

## Steps to Clean Up a Messy CRM

### 1. Data Audit

- Analysis of exact and approximate duplicates.
- Verification of critical information completeness.
- Consistency check between systems (CRM ↔ Billing ↔ Analytics).

### 2. Data Enrichment

- Completing missing information via API or third-party sources.
- Standardizing formats (emails, addresses, phone numbers).

### 3. Implementing Automated Workflows

- Duplicate detection during import.
- Mandatory field validation.
- Alerts for anomalies or inconsistent data.

### 4. Continuous Monitoring

- Data quality dashboards.
- Periodic audits to detect new inconsistencies.
- Integration of predictive models to identify churn risks or revenue loss.

## Typical Results

- **80% reduction in audit time** thanks to automation.
- **98% data reconciliation rate** between systems.
- **Identification of revenue leaks** amounting to several million dollars.
- **Nearly 50% reduction in customer churn** for B2B SaaS.
